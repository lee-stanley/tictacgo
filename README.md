# CLI Tic-Tac-Toe

A command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Go.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to play the game on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/lee-stanley/tictacgo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd tictacgo
```

3. Build the executable:

go build
```

### Usage

To start playing the Tic-Tac-Toe game, run the generated executable:

```

The game board will be displayed on the command line, and the players (X and O) will take turns making moves.

### How to Play

1. The game board is a 3x3 grid, where each cell is represented by its row and column index (0-based).
2. Players take turns making moves. On your turn, enter the row and column index where you want to place your marker.
3. The game will continue until one of the players wins or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
